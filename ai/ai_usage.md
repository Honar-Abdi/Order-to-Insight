## AI usage in this project

AI tools were used in a limited, transparent, and controlled manner to support the development process.

Their role was not to generate final solutions automatically, but to act as a secondary reviewer
and discussion partner, comparable to an external peer or code reviewer.

Specifically, AI was used to:
- sanity-check data modeling choices and identify potential edge cases
- suggest additional data quality checks and validation rules
- review analytical logic and highlight possible misinterpretations
- improve documentation clarity, structure, and wording

All final decisions regarding data modeling, SQL logic, analysis, and conclusions
were made manually and implemented by the author.

AI was not used to:
- generate production-ready code without human review
- make automated analytical, technical, or business decisions
- replace understanding of the data, its assumptions, or its limitations

The overall project design, implementation, and analytical reasoning reflect the
author’s own judgment and decision-making throughout the pipeline.
