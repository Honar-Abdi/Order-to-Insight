## AI usage in this project

AI tools were used in a limited and controlled way to support the development process.

Their role was not to generate final solutions automatically, but to act as a secondary reviewer and discussion partner.

Specifically, AI was used to:
- sanity-check data modeling choices and edge cases
- suggest potential data quality checks and validation rules
- review analytical logic and highlight possible misinterpretations
- help improve documentation clarity and structure

All final decisions regarding data modeling, SQL logic, analysis, and conclusions were made manually and implemented by the author.

AI was not used to:
- generate production-ready code without review
- make automated analytical or business decisions
- replace understanding of the data or its limitations
