## AI usage in this project

AI tools were used in a limited and transparent way to support development.

Their role was similar to that of a peer reviewer. challenging assumptions, suggesting edge cases,
and improving clarity. They were not used to automatically generate final solutions.

AI was used to:

- review data modeling decisions and identify potential edge cases  
- suggest additional data quality checks and validation logic  
- challenge analytical reasoning and highlight possible metric risks  
- improve documentation structure and language clarity  

All data modeling, SQL logic, analysis design, and final conclusions were
defined and implemented manually.

AI was not used to:

- generate end-to-end solutions without review  
- make automated business or technical decisions  
- replace understanding of the data, assumptions, or limitations  

The overall architecture, modeling decisions, and analytical reasoning
reflect the author's own judgment throughout the project.
